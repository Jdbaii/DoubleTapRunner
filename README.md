# DoubleTapRunner
Allows you to increase your speed by double-tapping forward (with stick or keyboard) with customizable multiplier. This works similar to the run button in most games.

Includes several settings that can be changed and works on the fly with both VR and Desktop during same game session so yes you can plugin your xbox controller if you want to

Until UIExpansionKit is updated, this mod will need to be manually enabled in MelonPreferences.cfg to work and settings will have to be changed there as well. UIExpansionKit update is coming soon.
